# My resume

## Lauri Annala
Sofware Developer, M.C.S student

## Currently

Building software with Elixir/Erlang/OTP and Rust.
I work at [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/).

### Specialized in

Software design and architecture.

### Interests

Functional programming with erlang and elixir. Efficient system development with c++ and rust.
Improving my workflows with unix-tools such as vim, emacs, tmux and zsh. Making friends at work and having mostly productive, yet always fun pair-coding sessions. When I code by myself, I listen to dark ambient or snes soundtracks as background music.

I love:
* Reading books about software, lovecraftian horror, fantasy, mysticism and wisdom
* Jamming to heavy metal songs with my (t)rusty old jackson guitar
* Lifting weights at my local gym while listening to [power-inducing hymns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf0sac4APLg)
* Watching Battlestar Galactica at home with the company of my dark lady (my wife)

I have good knowledge and experience with both relational and nosql databases.

My preferred development environment is unix-based machine with vim, emacs, tmux and zsh.
